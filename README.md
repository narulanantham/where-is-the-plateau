# where-is-the-plateau

TL;DR - I'm tracking how my average running pace is changing over time, while sticking to a training schedule of 30 minute runs, 3-4x per week.

Rules for data collection:

- Dec. 2024 to March 2025: 30 minute runs, 3x per week (phase 1; strongly "suggested" by PTs)
- April 2025 to present: 30 minute runs, 4x per week (phase 2)
  - Includes the occasional Monday night group run, which takes 5-10 minutes longer
- All runs are at an easy to tempo effort, as determined by average heart rate (flat over time)  
- No long runs, no interval training, definitely no sprinting :(
- Strength training is non-negotiable (2-3x per week; warm-up on the elliptical)
- Treadmill runs aren't included on the plot (average pace gets a bit jumbled)
