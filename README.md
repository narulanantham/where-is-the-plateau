# where-is-the-plateau
An experiment in whether running less will make me faster (and less injured) 

Rules for data collection:

- Dec. 2024 to March 2025: 30 minute runs, 3x per week 
- April 2025 to present: 30 minute runs, 4x per week (includes the occasional 3-4 mile Monday night group run, which takes 5-10 minutes longer)
- All runs are at an easy to tempo effort (no long runs, no interval training)
- Strength training is non-negotiable (2-3x per week; warm-up on the elliptical)
