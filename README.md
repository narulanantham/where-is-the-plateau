# where-is-the-plateau

TL;DR - I'm tracking how my average running pace is changing over time, while sticking to a training schedule of just 3-4 30 minute runs per week.  

Rules for data collection:

- Dec. 2024 to March 2025: 30 minute runs, 3x per week (phase 1; strongly "suggested" by PTs)
- April 2025 to present: 30 minute runs, 4x per week (includes the occasional 3-4 mile Monday night group run, which takes 5-10 minutes longer)
- All runs are at an easy to tempo effort (no long runs, no interval training, definitely no sprinting)
- Strength training is non-negotiable (2-3x per week; warm-up on the elliptical)
- Treadmill runs aren't included on the plot (average pace gets a bit jumbled)
